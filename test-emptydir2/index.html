                <div class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-2">
                    <p>Back at the dawn of the web it was impressive for a business to even just 'have' a web presence, regardless of what it looked like.
                        But the age of flaming skull gifs, flashing text, mouse cursor trails and red on yellow has (thankfully) passed.</p>
                    <p>The requirements for modern web architects have similarly evolved. It is no longer enough for us to <em>just</em> be able to develop or design a site.</p>

                    <h3>SEO</h3>
                    <p>Are you dominating every search keyword relevant to your site? Do you actually know what keywords are relevant or which keywords give you the best advertising ROI?</p>
                    <p>Your site is going no where if no one can find it. A web team today must able to help plan your content and SEO strategy, or at least understand what to do when one is presented to them.</p>
                    <p>Good SEO can mean life or death for some businesses or organisations.</p>

                    <h3>User Onboarding</h3>
                    <p>Where should a user start when using your site? Do they know that? Do you keep in touch with them regularly? Do you show them around?</p>
                    <p>Many developers forget that what is plainly obvious to them - because they built the site - is not always obvious to someone who has never seen it before.</p>
                    <p>Customers will love you if you give them just the right amount of handholding to let them slip into your app as if they had always been using it.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-md-offset-2">
                    <h3>User Experience</h3>
                    <p>Does your site bring joy or frustration to your users? <em>Do you even know which</em> or just assume they love it?</p>
                    <p>Developers should always keep the user experience at the front of their minds when implementing features, because a feature is useless unless customers need it and can actually <em>use it</em>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">

                    <h3>Marketing and Sales Automation</h3>
                    <p>When someone finds your site, does it guide them through why they should use it, or does it just smile at them and hope they buy?</p>
                    <p>Do you at least have a process to allow your visitors to opt in and give you their contact details so you can reach out to them, and warm them up before making a sale?</p>

                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-md-offset-2">
                    <h3>Developer Advocacy</h3>
                    <p>If your business needs other sites to connect with it or work with it, do you have someone on hand to show them how? Do you have well documented, easy to use APIs?</p>
                    <p>Few developers are able to write clear documentation, and even fewer are comfortable speaking in front of crowds or delivering training. However, these skills are vital for the success of a business that relies on other sites integrating with them.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
                    <h3>Web Standards</h3>
                    <p>Does your site look the same on every device and browser or only work on one? Does it break on some totally? <em>Have all the major ones been tested?</em></p>
                    <p>While browsers are getting more uniform in their implementations of standards, there are still differences, and businesses who don't test for these may find that a significant portion of their customer base simply can't use their site.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-md-offset-2">
                    <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
                    <p>Further to standardization, mobile users often expect and deserve a different experience to desktop users. Do you give them one? Are you aware that Google now takes into account how mobile friendly your site is in it's search results?</p>
                    <p>Responsiveness is about more than just squashing the site up into a single column. It is also about deciding which features are needed and which aren't and which new features need to be added to make the experience whole.</p>
                    <p>It's also about deciding what to load and when to ensure that lower bandwidth clients can still interact comfortably with your site.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
                    <h3>Analytics</h3>
                    <p>Do you track your visitors? Do you use that data to actually drive changes to your site or simply to worry if it's low or pat yourself on the back for "growth"?</p>
                    <p>If you don't understand the behavior of your visitors you can't even begin to accurately influence or improve it.</p>
                    <p>If you aren't running solid A/B testing of your entire site you will never know if red or green is the better color for your mailing list signup button.
                        <br><small>(Pro Tip: Counterintuitively, it's usually red)</small></p>

                    <h3>Copywriting<br> and Marketing Design</h3>
                    <p>Are you clearly presenting your WIIFM or is it just soft sales? Are your calls to action more like <em>kinda requests to maybe do something if you feel like it...</em></p>
                    <p>Copywriting also extends further than just a block of persuasive text on your home page. Calls to action, buttons, help pages and tooltips can all influence how customers feel about your site.</p>
                    <p>How many customers have walked away when 80% or 90% ready to buy because your site didn't give them that last good reason to buy?</p>

                    <h3>Social Media<br> and Community</h3>
                    <p>Comments, a forum or a Facebook plugin? Facebook, Twitter or G+? Do you know which is better for which situation? More importantly, <em>does your web team</em>?</p>
                    <p>A social media and community strategy is also important to most sites these days, as many sites can get as much, or even more, of their traffic from social media than from conventional searches.</p>
                    <p>Once you have that traffic, does your team mold a group of rabid fanbois and fangals from it, or a group of lukewarm spectators ready to wander off?</p>

                    <p class="lead text-center">Any one of the above factors can shift the traffic or conversion rate at your site by double digit percentages.
                        If your web team isn't thinking about of all of them, <br><strong>then your business is just leaving money on the table.</strong></p>

                        <p>Daniel is extraordinary, because he not only finishes every project he sets out on quickly, also his attitude is extremely positive.
                            I can easily say he's the most talented, energetic, and kindest developer I've ever worked with.</p>

                        <p>This rare blend of talent is so hard to find. Sometimes developers with his skill level either tend to be arrogant or abrasive.
                            Not Daniel. He has always been a kind-hearted person who puts his heart and soul into every project, considering how to solve
                            our business's problems and go above and beyond to give users a fantastic experience.</p>

                        <p>In terms of skill, he's a rarity in that his UX and back end skills are equally impressive. He took some of our existing (poorly commented)
                            PHP scripts and made them 5-10x more efficient, while giving them a gorgeous Angular.js front end that was absolutely seamless.
                            For instance, on the Cyrano and Eureka projects, his mastery of MySQL allowed him to create more efficient queries and temporary tables
                            to reduce the workload of our servers, allowing us to scale at a fraction the cost while increasing the speed of operations.
                            This led to greater ROI and a better user experience. I was just blown away.</p>

                        <p>If he lived in proximity to our current SaaS startup, you would not be seeing this testimonial because we would have already stolen him away from you.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes you may not be able to get #1 on your primary search term, but there is always alternate search terms that can bring as much or more traffic in aggregate that are far easier to dominate.</p>

            <h2>Product management is more than<br>just delivering on time</h2>
            <p>Imagine an app where new customers slide in like they had always been using it. Where existing customers keep coming back regularly
                and annoy their friends because they <em>just won't shut up about it</em>.</p>
            <p>This is the aim of a good product manager, to get people to love their product as much as they do, to use, and love using, the product and to promote the product to others. They have to walk a tightrope between the technical,
                business and customer sides all at the same time and keep them all in harmony.</p>
            <h3>I am not a rockstar, and that's a good thing.</h3>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-1">
                    <p>I am not a rockstar developer. If you are looking for one, then I am sorry for wasting your time.</p>
                    <p>I have worked with and employed rockstar developers before though. They write amazing code, often in record time and spend all their copious free time reading about the latest CSS tricks,
                        JavaScript classes or latest development methodologies. But their fatal flaw is that they usually lack the ability to look at the big picture.</p>
                    <p>To paraphrase an old saying: When asked for a drill, a rockstar developer will race off and produce a titanium coated, diamond tipped,
                        razor sharp work of art that will punch a hole through a girder automagically.</p>
                    <p><strong>I however</strong>, will first ask questions like: <em>"So what kind of hole are you are trying to make, how big, and in what? Who is going to use this hole, and how?"</em></p>
                    <p class="lead text-center"><strong>Because what that person really needs may not be a drill, but a shovel</strong></p>
                    <p>Managing and developing apps and sites is about more than just shiny features, fancy designs and delivery dates - though they definitely have their place.</p>
                    <p>It is primarily about who is supposed to use it, how they will use, what for and when. Then matching your product to those needs as best you can in such as way as to keep your users hooked and coming back.</p>
